Install `tilemaker`, from package or from compile it from source.

Run `make` to fetch all dependencies and compile the map. This will download about 3GiB of data, and use about 5GiB of temporary disk space.
If using your own compiled tilemaker, run it with `TILEMAKER=/path/to/tilemaker make`.

## Sources

Both `config.json` and `process-openmaptiles.lua` are adapted from tilemaker's sources.
